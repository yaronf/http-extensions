                     The ORIGIN Extension in HTTP/3
                  draft-ietf-httpbis-origin-h3-latest

Abstract

   The ORIGIN frame for HTTP/2 is equally applicable to HTTP/3, but
   needs to be separately registered.  This document describes the
   ORIGIN frame for HTTP/3.

1.  Introduction

   Existing RFCs define extensions to HTTP/2 [HTTP2] which remain useful
   in HTTP/3.  Appendix A.2.3 of [HTTP3] describes the required updates
   for HTTP/2 frames to be used with HTTP/3.

   [ORIGIN] defines the HTTP/2 ORIGIN frame, which indicates what
   origins are available on a given connection.  It defines a single
   HTTP/2 frame type.

2.  The ORIGIN HTTP/3 Frame

   The ORIGIN HTTP/3 frame allows a server to indicate what origin(s)
   ([RFC6454]) the server would like the client to consider as members
   of the Origin Set (Section 2.3 of [ORIGIN]) for the connection within
   which it occurs.

   The semantics of the frame payload are identical to those of the
   HTTP/2 frame defined in [ORIGIN].  Where HTTP/2 reserves Stream 0 for
   frames related to the state of the connection, HTTP/3 defines a pair
   of unidirectional streams called "control streams" for this purpose.
   Where [ORIGIN] indicates that the ORIGIN frame should be sent on
   Stream 0, this should be interpreted to mean the HTTP/3 control
   stream.  The ORIGIN frame is sent from servers to clients on the
   server's control stream.

2.1.  Frame Layout

   The ORIGIN frame has a nearly identical layout to that used in
   HTTP/2, restated here for clarity.  The ORIGIN frame type is 0xc
   (decimal 12) as in HTTP/2.  The payload contains zero or more
   instances of the Origin-Entry field.

   HTTP/3 Origin-Entry {
     Origin-Len (16),
     ASCII-Origin (..),
   }

   HTTP/3 ORIGIN Frame {
     Type (i) = 0x0c,
     Length (i),
     Origin-Entry (..) ...,
   }

                       Figure 1: ORIGIN Frame Layout

   An Origin-Entry is a length-delimited string.  Specifically, it
   contains two fields:

   Origin-Len:  An unsigned, 16-bit integer indicating the length, in
      octets, of the ASCII-Origin field.

   ASCII-Origin:  An OPTIONAL sequence of characters containing the
      ASCII serialization of an origin ([RFC6454], Section 6.2) that the
      sender asserts this connection is or could be authoritative for.

3.  Security Considerations

   This document introduces no new security considerations beyond those
   discussed in [ORIGIN] and [HTTP3].

4.  IANA Considerations

   This document registers a frame type in the "HTTP/3 Frame Type"
   registry ([HTTP3]).

                  +============+=======+===============+
                  | Frame Type | Value | Specification |
                  +============+=======+===============+
                  | ORIGIN     |  0xc  | Section 2     |
                  +------------+-------+---------------+
